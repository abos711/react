STRETCH

Create two additional resources. Caretaker and Kid as many to many relationship, The activity will be attached to the kid which will can be access and edited by daycare, babysitter, grandparents (caretakers/parent). And if parents have more then one kiddo you would liek to add many kids to a single parent.
